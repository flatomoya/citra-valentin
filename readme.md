Citra Valentin is a open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++ tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10.

Citra Valentin emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications, and it's also able to run many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state.

Citra Valentin is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.
